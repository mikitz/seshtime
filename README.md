# Sesh Time

A Discord bot that helps me to schedule and manage the sessions I DM for DnD 5e.

## Ideas

-   _Maybe_ players should only be notified ~24 hours prior to deadline instead of as the **Reminder Frequency** dictates?
-   Add a button to each session to reschedule with a new date. This would copy all data from the session except the date, which would require user input.

## Features

### Settings

-   **Game Master Role ID** `gameMasterRoleId` = The role of the game master for an event.
    -   This is used to cancel an event if the event author has this role and RSVPs as _Not Attending_.
-   **Player Role ID** `playerRoleId` = The role of the players.
    -   This is used to determine the group size. The group size is used to determine when a session must be automatically canceled due to having to many _Not Attending_ players using `notAttending > groupSize - minPlayers`.
-   **Minimum Players** `minPlayers` = The minimum number of players in order to have a session.
-   **Maximum Players** `maxPlayers` = The maximum number of players for a session.
-   **RSVP Deadline** `rsvpDeadline` = The number of days prior to the session datetime that players must RSVP by.
    -   This is used to automatically cancel a session if **Minimum Players** is not satisfied by the specified date.
-   **Reminder Frequency** `reminderFrequency` = The number of days between reminders for players who are _Pending_ or _Maybe_.
-   **Time Zone** `timezone` = The time zone in which to schedule the sessions.

## Dependencies

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/)
3. [Keyv](https://keyv.org/)

## Known Issues

-   `database.js` - TTL needs 1,700,564,000,000ms subtracted from it to work
    -   If this is subtracted, the KV pair gets deleted on `Keyv.get()`
    -   [BAND-AID FIX] All events for the current guild are scanned upon event creation in `create-session.js`.
